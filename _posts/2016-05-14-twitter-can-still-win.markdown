Let's face it, Facebook and Twitter are media companies. The major TV networks were both doing cutting edge tech once until the technology became ubiquitous and they became old, boring media companies. This day is rapidly approaching for social networks.

Stratchery and others have commented on how FB biases everything towards what your friends think, creating a myopic world view. To win, Twitter doesn't even have to be more open and unbias their feed. Fox News's money is the same color as NBC's. Don't be literal though. I'm not saying Twitter should go conservative to counterbalance's FB's left-leaning "journalism" (though I think being the more irreverent media company to counterbalance FB's staid lady grey approach would be smart), but more that it can win by just accepting itself as a media company. FB sponsored stories make it clear that FB has known this for awhile. 

Evidence that Twitter understands it is thankfully emerging. They secured the rights to broadcast NFL football games this fall. This seems like a critical move for their future and it's hard to understand why it didn't get more airtime. Media companies still love Twitter (journalists want to be heard!) more than the stock market does, so I say it's about time Twitter took some of Fox News' swag and embraced being the stuff your dad sits on couch to watch.
