# PhD === Startup 
The government and universities should leverage this fact. Professors lead the accelerators like a VC. PhD students are CEO.

### All the contrasts are actually comparisons
The budget - Your PhD being a startup fits incredibly well with how PhDs already go. Professors control the student's budget, which is often Seed or Series A in dollar value, 5-6-7 figures. The students salary is a founder salary ( < minimum wage).

The investor - Like your investor, your advisor/professor should only be trusted for the money part. A meddling professor isn't good just like a meddling investor isn't. Like D-list investors, crappy professors aren't focused on an important bottom line. Obviously they can be, but too many professors are chasing vanity metrics like publishing in Nature.

The business - Some people will say business != research project. One is to make money, one is for knowledge! This is large % of cases, all just about the timing of the payoff. Of course the government wants your thing to have an impact on the world. Please tell me a scenario where impact has no bearing on money. I'll wait.

The founder - Just out of college, you are clueless but hungry. You want to learn. During your phd/startup you will. Also, the period of your phd/startup
