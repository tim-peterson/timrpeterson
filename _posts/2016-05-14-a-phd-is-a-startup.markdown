## **PhD == Startup. The governments and universities should leverage this truthiness and the good ones will.** 


#### All the contrasts are actually comparisons
The budget - Your PhD being a startup fits incredibly well with how PhDs already go. Professors control the student's budget, which is often Seed or Series A in dollar value, 5-6-7 figures. The students salary is a founder salary ( < minimum wage).

The investor - A Professor leads their lab like a VC leads an accelerator. There are many projects, mostly duds but a double/triples and the rare home run. Like your investor, your advisor/professor should only be trusted for the money part. A meddling professor isn't good just like a meddling investor isn't. Like D-list investors, crappy professors aren't focused on the bottom line. Obviously they can be, but too many professors are chasing vanity metrics like publishing in Nature. 

The business - Some people will say business != research project. One is to make money, one is for knowledge! This is large % of cases, all just about the timing of the payoff. Of course the government wants your thing to have an impact on the world. Please tell me a scenario where impact has no bearing on money. I'll wait.

The founder - Just out of college, the PhD/CEO student is clueless but hungry. They want to learn. During your phd/startup you will. Also, length of your phd/startup, 3-6 years, is great amount of time to learn how to learn. After that, you can do whatever. You will be better at the next thing.

Stanford is known for promoting entrepreneurship and for their professors embracing the phd/startup mindset (Google co-founders being a most famous example). Harvard is famously not. Betting against Harvard is like betting against the Yankees. Stranger things happen in sports, Steph Curry, so I wouldn't be too surprised by the same happening in academics.
