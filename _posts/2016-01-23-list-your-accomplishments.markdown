Make a list of your accomplishments. Write them down. All of them. Regularly. The cloud (srsly) makes this possible very easily. With the cloud, there is no reason to not do this. It gives your accomplishments permanence. We can now easily be our own historians. Einstein had numerous colleagues essential to his success, but historians only list the accomplishments as they were Einstein's alone. You don't know any of Einstein's colleagues names so writing down your place in history matters.


##### What the people in your life are thinking
Nobody will remember what you've done. People will attribute your accomplishments to other people or not remember them at all. It only makes sense our accomplishments.  

##### Evidence of successful people who do this
Donald trump does this and its a highly effective communication strategy. His kids have even more opportunity then he had at the same age but they do not have the same success because they don't communicate as effectively.

##### Areas of life where this is useful
All of them. It is useful in your personal life. Increasingly women and men are sharing responsibilities in raising families. Making a list of your accomplishments clarifies your contribution as mother or father.

It is useful in startups. It is useful in academia. In any work scenario, making a list of accomplishments gives you leverage in negotiations.
