I'm a postdoc at Harvard in molecular biology. Starting next July (2016) I'm going to be a assistant professor in the department of medicine at Washington University St. Louis.

I've created [Onarbor](https://onarbor.com/) and previously, [Leangap](https://leangap.com/).

My lab site will be available soon at: [lab.timrpeterson.com](http://lab.timrpeterson.com/)
